## What is an Online Pendulum Oracle?

The online pendulum oracle is a digital adaptation of a traditional divination tool. It combines the ancient practice of pendulum dowsing with the convenience of online accessibility. Typically, a real pendulum (a weighted object suspended from a chain) is used to answer questions by swinging in different directions, indicating "yes," "no," or "maybe." An online version simulates this process, often using algorithms or randomized responses to provide answers.

This **free pendulum oracle course** will teach you the fundamentals of understanding and interpreting the answers you receive. It is suitable for beginners with no prior experience.
